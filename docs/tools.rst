Tools
=====

Some additional tools are provided with our library. Even though most of them
are geared at internal usage, they are all presented here. Amongst them, the
ones most probable of being of use for you are in the :ref:`math` section,
presenting mathematical tools for linear algebra, functions generalized to more 
data types, etc...

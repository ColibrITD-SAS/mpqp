Getting started
===============

Installation
------------

.. TODO: grab the compatibility matrix from MyQLM and relax our requirements 
.. when possible, test on many different configurations (tox or other ?)

For now, we support python versions 3.9 to 3.11, and both Windows, Linux and 
MacOS (specifically, Linux was validated on Ubuntu LTS 20.04, while Ubuntu 18.04 
is not supported, so your milage may vary).

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install mpqp

.. note::
    For mac users, additional steps are required before the installation, 
    specifically because of the ``myqlm`` library. To run these steps, you can 
    either follow their instructions on 
    `this page <https://myqlm.github.io/01_getting_started/%3Amyqlm%3Amacos.html#macos>`_
    or run the script we created to facilitate this step:

    .. code-block:: bash

        curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColibrITD-SAS/mpqp/main/mac-install.sh | bash -s -- <your-python-bin>
        
    where ``<your-python-bin>`` is the binary you use to invoke python. It could
    for instance be ``python``, ``python3``, ``python3.9``, etc...

Your first circuit
------------------

A circuit is created by providing :class:`QCircuit<mpqp.core.circuit.QCircuit>`
a list of :class:`Instruction<mpqp.core.instruction.instruction.Instruction>` 
(gates and measurement). To run a circuit, you can then use the 
:func:`run<mpqp.execution.runner.run>` function.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from mpqp import QCircuit
    >>> from mpqp.gates import X, CNOT
    >>> from mpqp.measures import BasisMeasure
    >>> print(QCircuit([X(0),CNOT(0, 1), BasisMeasure([0, 1], shots=100)]))
         ┌───┐     ┌─┐
    q_0: ┤ X ├──■──┤M├───
         └───┘┌─┴─┐└╥┘┌─┐
    q_1: ─────┤ X ├─╫─┤M├
              └───┘ ║ └╥┘

.. _Remote setup:

Setup remote accesses
---------------------

Installing MPQP gives you access to ``setup_connections`` a script facilitating
the setting up of remote QPU connections. The three supported providers (qiskit,
Qaptiva, braket, Azure and IonQ) can be setup from this script. Each of these providers have
their own set of data needed to setup the connection, summed up here:

- IBM quantum (qiskit): for this provider, you only need your account ``API
  token``, which you can find in your `account page <https://quantum.ibm.com/account>`_;
- Atos/Eviden (Qaptiva/QLM): for this provider, several connection methods
  exist. For now we only support the username/password method. You should have
  received you username and password by email;
- AWS (braket): for this provider, you will need more information: all of them can
  be found in your 
  `AWS console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?nc2=h_ct&src=header-signin>`_.
  In the console go to the ``IAM service``, in the ``Users`` tab, click on your
  username, in the ``Security credential`` tab, you'll find an ``Access keys`` 
  section. In this section, you can create a new access key for ``MPQP``, you 
  should save it because you will not be able to get back your secret latter on.
  This will give you your key and your secret, but for the configuration you 
  also need a region (for example ``us-east-1``). In short, one would need:

  + ``AWS Access Key ID``,
  + ``AWS Secret Access Key`` and
  + ``Default region name``.
- Azure: For this provider, you need to have an Azure account and create an Azure Quantum workspace.
  To create an Azure Quantum workspace, follow the steps at:
  `Azure Quantum workspace <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/how-to-create-workspace?tabs=tabid-quick>`_.
  Once you have your Quantum workspace, you can go to the ``Overview`` section, where you will find your ``Resource ID`` and ``Location``
- IonQ: For this provider, you need to have an IonQ account and create an ``API token``.
  You can obtain it from the IonQ Console under `IonQ setting keys <https://cloud.ionq.com/settings/keys>`_.

Execute examples
----------------

A few examples are provided in the ``examples`` folder of the repo. To try them
out, you can either download them individually from `our GitHub repository 
<https://github.com/ColibrITD-SAS/mpqp>`_ or cloning the repository and
executing them as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m examples.scripts.bell_pair
    $ python -m examples.scripts.demonstration
    $ python -m examples.scripts.observable_job

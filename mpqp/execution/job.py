"""
When you call :func:`run<mpqp.execution.runner.run>` or
:func:`submit<mpqp.execution.runner.submit>`, a :class:`Job` is created by 
:func:`generate_job<mpqp.execution.runner.generate_job>`. This job contains all
the needed information to configure the execution, and eventually retrieve
remote results.

A :class:`Job` can be of three types, given by the :class:`JobType` enum. In 
addition, it has a status, given by the :class:`JobStatus` enum.

As described above, a :class:`Job` is generated on circuit submission so you
would in principle never need to instantiate one yourself.

"""This module contains the tools to check if a result obtained by running the 
circuit on one of our provider's device produce a result compatible with the
theory. (Which could itself be useful to find problems either in our code or in
our provider's code.)

In order to do so, :func:`theoretical_probs` performs a theoretical simulation 
of a :class:`~mpqp.core.circuit.QCircuit`. The noise models in the circuit will
be taken into account (but not the shot noise).

This theoretical simulation will be compared against the execution on a
:class:`~mpqp.execution.devices.AvailableDevice` in :func:`exp_id_dist`. This
comparison is performed using a distance between statistical distribution called
the Jensen-Shannon distance.

If the distance is small enough, :func:`validate_noisy_circuit` will return
``True``, meaning that the empirical data is within the expected range. 

The size of the trust interval is computed in :func:`trust_int` by computing the
Jensen-Shannon distance between a non noisy circuit and a noisy one. The idea
being that the more noise you have in a circuit, the bigger your trust interval
needs to be (the uncertainty is bigger).

The interval size is not linearly related with this distance so this needs to be
passed in a re-normalizing function before being used. This is the role
:func:`dist_alpha_matching` is playing."""
